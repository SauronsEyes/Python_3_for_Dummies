Gehinnom is not Hell, but originally a grave and in later times a sort of Purgatory where one is judged based on one\'s life\'s deeds, or rather, where one becomes fully aware of one\'s own shortcomings and negative actions during one\'s life. The <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> explains it as a "waiting room" (commonly translated as an "entry way") for all souls (not just the wicked). The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in Gehinnom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 12 months, however there has been the occasional noted exception. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to <a href="/wiki/Jewish_eschatology#The_afterlife_and_olam_haba_(the_world_to_come)" title="Jewish eschatology">Olam Habah</a> (<i>heb.</i> \xd7\xa2\xd7\x95\xd7\x9c\xd7\x9d \xd7\x94\xd7\x91\xd7\x90; <i>lit.</i> "The world to come", often viewed as analogous to heaven). This is also mentioned in the Kabbalah, where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure and the "unfinished" piece being reborn.According to Jewish teachings, hell is not entirely physical; rather, it can be compared to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of <a href="/wiki/God_in_Judaism" title="God in Judaism">God</a>, one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of <a href="/wiki/Teshuva" class="mw-redirect" title="Teshuva">teshuva</a> (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment.

Of the hell realms, the worst is <i><a href="/wiki/Avici" class="mw-redirect" title="Avici">Av\xc4\xabci</a></i> or "endless suffering".

In the <a href="/wiki/Lotus_Sutra" title="Lotus Sutra">Lotus Sutra</a>, the Buddha teaches that eventually even Devadatta will become a Pratyekabuddha himself, emphasizing the temporary nature of the Hell realms.

In popular literature, Ksitigarbha travels to the Hell realms to teach and relieve beings of their suffering.Early Vedic religion does not have a concept of Hell. \xe1\xb9\x9ag-veda mentions three realms, bh\xc5\xabr (the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">earth</a>), svar (the <a href="/wiki/Sky" title="Sky">sky</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Loka" title="Loka">bhuvas</a> or antarik\xe1\xb9\xa3a (the middle area, i.e. air or <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>). In later Hindu literature, especially the law books and Puranas, more realms are mentioned, including a realm similar to Hell, called <a href="/wiki/Naraka" title="Naraka">naraka</a> (in Devan\xc4\x81gar\xc4\xab: \xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa4\x95). <a href="/wiki/Yama" title="Yama">Yama</a> as the first born human (together with his twin sister <a href="/wiki/Yamuna_in_Hinduism" title="Yamuna in Hinduism">Yam\xc4\xab</a>), by virtue of precedence, becomes ruler of men and a judge on their departure.

It is a lower spiritual plane (called <i>naraka-loka</i>) where the spirit is judged and the partial fruits of <a href="/wiki/Karma" title="Karma">karma</a> affect the next life. In <a href="/wiki/Mahabharata" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> there is a mention of the <a href="/wiki/Pandavas" class="mw-redirect" title="Pandavas">Pandavas</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kauravas" class="mw-redirect" title="Kauravas">Kauravas</a> both going to Heaven. At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying heaven; Indra tells him that Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties. Then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are. Later it is revealed that this was a test for Yudhisthir and that his brothers and the Kauravas are all in heaven and live happily in the divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various <a href="/wiki/Purana" class="mw-redirect" title="Purana">Puranas</a> and other scriptures. The Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell and its features; it lists the amount of punishment for most crimes, much like a modern-day penal code.It is believed that people who commit sins go to Hell and have to go through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god <a href="/wiki/Yama_(Hinduism)" title="Yama (Hinduism)">Yamar\xc4\x81ja</a>, who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by <a href="/wiki/Chitragupta" title="Chitragupta">Chitragupta</a>, who is the record keeper in Yama\'s court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of <a href="/wiki/Karma" title="Karma">karma</a>. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to <a href="/wiki/Svarga" title="Svarga">svarga</a>, a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.According to <a href="/wiki/Brahma_Kumaris" title="Brahma Kumaris">Brahma Kumaris</a> iron world (kalyug, a stage of world cycle) regarded as hell.In <a href="/wiki/Jain_cosmology" title="Jain cosmology">Jain cosmology</a>, Naraka (translated as hell) is the name given to realm of existence having great suffering.

Furthermore, length of a being\'s stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long\xe2\x80\x94measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous <a href="/wiki/Karma_in_Jainism" title="Karma in Jainism">karma</a> (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.The hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe.

They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> For example, <a href="/wiki/Guru_Arjan" title="Guru Arjan">Guru Arjan</a> explains that people who are entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell on this Earth i.e. their life is hellish.So many are being drowned in emotional attachment and doubt; they dwell in the most horrible hell.Ancient <a href="/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> had no concept of Hell, as morality was seen to be a man-made distinction and there was no concept of an immaterial soul. In its home country <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, where Taoism adopted tenets of other religions, popular belief endows Taoist Hell with many deities and spirits who punish sin in a variety of horrible ways.<i>Diyu</i> is the realm of the dead in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_mythology" title="Chinese mythology">Chinese mythology</a>. It is very loosely based upon the <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> concept of <a href="/wiki/Naraka_(Buddhism)" title="Naraka (Buddhism)">Naraka</a> combined with traditional Chinese afterlife beliefs and a variety of popular expansions and re-interpretations of these two traditions. Ruled by <a href="/wiki/Yama_(East_Asia)" class="mw-redirect" title="Yama (East Asia)">Yanluo Wang</a>, the King of Hell, Diyu is a maze of underground levels and chambers where souls are taken to atone for their earthly sins.Incorporating ideas from <a href="/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> as well as traditional Chinese folk religion, Diyu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation. There are many deities associated with the place, whose names and purposes are the subject of much conflicting information.The exact number of levels in Chinese Hell - and their associated deities - differs according to the Buddhist or Taoist perception. Some speak of three to four \'Courts\', other as many as ten. The ten judges are also known as the 10 Kings of <a href="/wiki/Yama_(Buddhism_and_Chinese_mythology)" class="mw-redirect" title="Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)">Yama</a>. Each Court deals with a different aspect of atonement. For example, murder is punished in one Court, adultery in another. According to some Chinese legends, there are eighteen levels in Hell. Punishment also varies according to belief, but most legends speak of highly imaginative chambers where wrong-doers are sawn in half, beheaded, thrown into pits of filth or forced to climb trees adorned with sharp blades.However, most legends agree that once a soul (usually referred to as a \'ghost\') has atoned for their deeds and repented, he or she is given the Drink of Forgetfulness by <a href="/wiki/Meng_Po" title="Meng Po">Meng Po</a> and sent back into the world to be reborn, possibly as an animal or a poor or sick person, for further punishment.<a href="/wiki/Zoroastrianism" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> has historically suggested several possible fates for the wicked, including annihilation, purgation in molten metal, and eternal punishment, all of which have standing in Zoroaster\'s writings. <a href="/wiki/Zoroastrian_eschatology" class="mw-redirect" title="Zoroastrian eschatology">Zoroastrian eschatology</a> includes the belief that wicked souls will remain in hell until, following the arrival of three saviors at thousand-year intervals, <a href="/wiki/Ahura_Mazda" title="Ahura Mazda">Ahura Mazda</a> reconciles the world, destroying evil and resurrecting tormented souls to perfection.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>The sacred <a href="/wiki/Gathas" title="Gathas">Gathas</a> mention a "House of the Lie\xe2\x80\xb3 for those "that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars."<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> However, the best-known Zoroastrian text to describe hell in detail is the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Arda_Viraf" title="Book of Arda Viraf">Book of Arda Viraf</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> It depicts particular punishments for particular sins\xe2\x80\x94for instance, being trampled by cattle as punishment for neglecting the needs of work animals.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Other descriptions can be found in the <i>Book of Scriptures (Hadhokht Nask), Religious Judgments (Dadestan-i Denig)</i> and the <i>Book of the Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom (Mainyo-I-Khard)</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>In <a href="/wiki/Wicca" title="Wicca">Wicca</a>, there is no such thing as hell because Wiccans largely do not believe in the concept of punishment or reward.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Although Wiccan views differ among different denominations, Wiccans tend to prefer viewing the <a href="/wiki/Horned_God" title="Horned God">Horned God</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Goddess_(Wicca)" class="mw-redirect" title="Goddess (Wicca)">Goddess</a> as gentle deities.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>In his <i><a href="/wiki/Divine_Comedy" title="Divine Comedy">Divina commedia</a></i> ("Divine comedy"; set in the year 1300), <a href="/wiki/Dante" class="mw-redirect" title="Dante">Dante Alighieri</a> employed the concept of taking <a href="/wiki/Virgil" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of <a href="/wiki/Purgatory" title="Purgatory">Purgatorio</a>). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante\'s poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">Limbo</a> just at the edge of Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at the center of the world, Dante finds <a href="/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a> himself trapped in the frozen lake of <a href="/wiki/Cocytus" title="Cocytus">Cocytus</a>. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other side of the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.<a href="/wiki/John_Milton" title="John Milton">John Milton</a>\'s <i><a href="/wiki/Paradise_Lost" title="Paradise Lost">Paradise Lost</a></i> (1667) opens with the <a href="/wiki/Fallen_angel" title="Fallen angel">fallen angels</a>, including their leader <a href="/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a>, waking up in Hell after having been defeated in the war in heaven and the action returns there at several points throughout the poem. Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through the corruption of the human race. 19th-century French poet <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud" title="Arthur Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a> alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, <i><a href="/wiki/Une_Saison_en_Enfer" class="mw-redirect" title="Une Saison en Enfer">A Season In Hell</a></i>. Rimbaud\'s poetry portrays his own suffering in a poetic form as well as other themes.Many of the great epics of European literature include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet <a href="/wiki/Virgil" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>\'s Latin epic, the <i><a href="/wiki/Aeneid" title="Aeneid">Aeneid</a></i>, Aeneas descends into <a href="/wiki/Hades" title="Hades">Dis</a> (the underworld) to visit his father\'s spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.The idea of Hell was highly influential to writers such as <a href="/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> who authored the 1944 play "<a href="/wiki/No_Exit" title="No Exit">No Exit</a>" about the idea that "Hell is other people". Although not a religious man, Sartre was fascinated by his interpretation of a Hellish state of suffering. <a href="/wiki/C.S._Lewis" class="mw-redirect" title="C.S. Lewis">C.S.

Hell is portrayed here as an endless, desolate twilight city upon which night is imperceptibly sinking. The night is actually the <a href="/wiki/Apocalypse" title="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>, and it heralds the arrival of the demons after their judgment. Before the night comes, anyone can escape Hell if they leave behind their former selves and accept Heaven\'s offer, and a journey to Heaven reveals that Hell is infinitely small; it is nothing more or less than what happens to a soul that turns away from God and into itself.<a href="/wiki/Piers_Anthony" title="Piers Anthony">Piers Anthony</a> in his series <i><a href="/wiki/Incarnations_of_Immortality" title="Incarnations of Immortality">Incarnations of Immortality</a></i> portrays examples of Heaven and Hell via Death, Fate, Underworld, Nature, War, Time, Good-God, and Evil-Devil. <a href="/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein" title="Robert A.
